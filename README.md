# Standards
Personal code style standards, setting up a laptop, and environments. I had to set up a laptop a few too many times this summer. Time to document it. This assumes you're using a Mac.

### Seed phase

If you can even read this, you're probably on Google Chrome already... but the first step is to of course install Google Chrome.

1. Add your `Applications` folder to the dock
1. [Install Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and get out of Safari
  * Enable warn before quitting
1. Log into [Spotify](https://play.spotify.com/) and turn on some music because this is going to be a long journey
2. Configure system preferences
  * [Enable root user](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204012)
  * Display: Scaled & more space
  * Keyboard: Fast key repeat, short delay until repeat, adjust keyboard brightness, show keyboard & character viewers, add 2-set Korean keyboard
  * Trackpad: Enable all, speed up tracking speed
  * Dock: Smaller, a little magnification, automatically hide/show dock (?)
3. Install Xcode
4. [Install Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
5. Set up [Sublime package control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).
6. Install [Slack](https://slack.com/downloads) and sign into your slack teams.
7. Log into [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), because you definitely need the distractions.
8. Install [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/)
9. Configure your git
  * `git config --global user.name "Chelsea Valentine"`
  * `git config --global user.email cv851@nyu.edu`
  * Ask git to [stop asking for your login information each time](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/)
    - Spoiler: you probably just need to paste in `git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain`
10. Install [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and [find the license code in your email](https://inbox.google.com/search/sketch%20license%20thank%20you%20for%20buying%20sketch)
11. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
  * `brew install node;`
12. `cd ~/; mkdir Workspace; mkdir Portfolio; cd Workspace; git clone https://github.com/chelseavalentine/Standards.git; cd Standards; cp .bash_profile ~/.bash_profile`
13. Open Finder, View -> Show Path Bar
