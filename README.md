# Setup
A script to setup software and programming environments. I decided to create this script because I've had to set up Macbook Pros a few too many times.

## Running the script
```
git clone https://github.com/chelseavalentine/Setup
cd Setup && chmod 755 first_setup.sh && ./first_setup.sh
```

## Things that must be done manually

1. System Preferences
  * Display: Scaled + Most space
  * Date & Time: Clock -> Show date
2. Download and pin desired App Store apps
3. Enter license codes
  * [Sketch 3](https://inbox.google.com/search/sketch%20license%20thank%20you%20for%20buying%20sketch)

## Things I need to implement
1. Configure system preferences
  * Keyboard: Show keyboard & character viewers, add 2-set Korean keyboard
  * Trackpad: Enable all, speed up tracking speed
  * Dock: Smaller, a little magnification, automatically hide/show dock (?)
2. [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
  * Install more APKs (Tools -> Android -> SDK Manager)
3. Install log4j

### Settlement phase

1. [Sign into Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/signin)
10. [Install docker](www.docker.com)
