# Standards
Personal code style standards, setting up a laptop, and environments. I had to set up a laptop a few too many times this summer. Time to document it. This assumes you're using a Mac.

### Setup

If you can even read this, you're probably on Google Chrome already... but the first step is to of course install Google Chrome.

1. Add your `Applications` folder to the dock
2. [Install Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and get out of Safari
  * Enable warn before quitting
3. Log into [Spotify](https://play.spotify.com/) and turn on some music because this is going to be a long journey
4. Configure system preferences
  * Display full name
  * Display: Scaled & more space
  * Keyboard: Fast key repeat, short delay until repeat, adjust keyboard brightness, show keyboard & character viewers, add 2-set Korean keyboard
  * Trackpad: Enable all, speed up tracking speed
  * Dock: Smaller, a little magnification, automatically hide/show dock (?)
  * Date & time: display the time with seconds, show date
5. Install Xcode
